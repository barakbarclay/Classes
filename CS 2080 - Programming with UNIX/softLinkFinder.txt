#Title:         Soft Link Finder
#Due Date:      21 March 2018
#Description:   This script finds all soft links to a
#		specific file. If more or less than
#		one argument is entered, it will print
#		an error message. If one argument is
#		entered and the file does not exist or
#		is empty, it will print an error message.
#		If both of these checks are passed, the
#		soft links to the file will be found and 
#		printed. 
#
#Exit Values
#       0       if sucessfully completed
#       10      incorrect number of arguments
#       20	file does not exist or is empty 

#validate$#argvs
if ( $#argv != 1 ) then
	echo This script requires one argument.
	exit 10
endif

#validateFile
if ( ! -s "$argv[1]" ) then
        echo "$argv[1] does not exist or is empty." 
        exit 20
endif

#Finds and prints the soft links of the file
