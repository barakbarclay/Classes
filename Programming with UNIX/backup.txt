#Title:         Backup
#Due Date:      9 April 2018
#Description:   This script creates backups of the files listed in
#		the file passed. These backups are saved in the
#		directory passed with .bak extensions. The first
#		argument is used for the file while the second
#		argument is used for the directory. This scripts
#		checks that only two arguments are passed, the first
#		argument is a file, and the second argument is a
#		directory. If the arguments do not pass these 
#		checks, then the script will exit and the
#		corresponding exit values will be used. Otherwise,
#		the script will go on to create backups of the files
#		listed in the passed file. 
#
#Exit Values
#       0       if sucessfully completed
#       10      incorrect number of arguments
#       20	arg1 does not exist or is not a file
#	30	arg2 does not exist is not a directory
